<h1 class="mb-6 h1">Building a Personal Website with Rust and Axum</h1>

<p class="mb-4 body-text">
    I mainly use React at work, which I'm not a particularly big fan of for a
    multiude of reasons I won't go into much detail here. So, when choosing a
    stack to build my personal website in, React was out of the question. I wanted
    to try out Svelte because I have heard good things about it from my
    co-workers, but Svelte is still JavaScript frontend framework number
    #92321223.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 body-text">
    So, after not so much consideration, I went with what I knew when I first
    started building websites, templating. But with a bit of a twist. I am
    learning Rust in pursuit of my goal to deepen my knowledge on systems
    engineering, so it seemed like a natural choice. As for why I chose Axum?
    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Reddit recommends it and it seemed simple enough. And it really
    is!
</p>

<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 h2">Getting Started</h2>

<p class="mb-4 body-text">
    First, let's set up a basic Axum server. You'll need to add the following
    dependencies to your <code class="code-inline">Cargo.toml</code> file:
</p>

<div class="code-block">
<pre>[dependencies]
axum = "0.6"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tower = "0.4"</pre>
</div>

<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 h2">Creating the Server</h2>

<p class="mb-4 body-text">Seems simple enough:</p>

<ul class="mb-4 ml-8 space-y-2 list-disc">
    <li>define some paths on the router</li>
    <li>get a host and a port on which to run this bad boy on</li>
    <li>launch the server</li>
</ul>

<div class="code-block">
<pre>use axum::{Router, routing::get};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/", get(root))
        .route("/about", get(about));

    let addr = "0.0.0.0:3000".parse().unwrap();
    println!("listening on {}", addr);
    
    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}

async fn root() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, World!"
}

async fn about() -> &'static str {
    "About page"
}</pre>
</div>

<h3 class="mt-6 mb-4 h3">Running the Application</h3>

<p class="mb-4 body-text">
    To run your application, simply use
    <code class="code-inline">cargo run</code> in your terminal. The server will
    start listening on port 3000.
</p>

<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 h2">Styling with Tailwind and Gruvbox</h2>

<p class="mb-4 body-text">
    For styling, I combined Tailwind CSS with the Gruvbox color scheme. I am basically obsessed with Gruvbox in general, I run it on everything, so it seemed natural to also use it for the personal website.
</p>

<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 h2">Adding Templates with Askama</h2>

<p class="mb-4 body-text">
    For templating, I chose Askama because it provides compile-time template
    checking. This means template errors are caught during compilation rather than
    at runtime:
</p>

<div class="code-block">
<pre>use askama_axum::Template;

#[derive(Template)]
#[template(path = "index.html")]
struct IndexTemplate {
    title: String,
    content: String,
}</pre>
</div>

<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 h2">Future Improvements</h2>

<p class="mb-4 body-text">
    I plan to add some interactivity to the website besides the small dark/light mode toggle to test "frameworks" like HTMX. I've used it in another templating projects slightly, but I want to see how far a thing like HTMX could be pushed until one needs to crawl back in React's arm.
