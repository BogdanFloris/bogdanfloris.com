                    I'm Bogdan, a software engineer with 6 YOE from Bucharest, Romania. I currently work at <a class="link" href="https://datacamp.com">DataCamp</a>, where we are building a platform which people of all
                    backgrounds or experiences can use to learn data and programming skills. I work there as a senior full stack engineer in the
                    Content Platform team, where we work on enabling new technologies that can be used to create courses in and maintain the platform where said courses are created.

                <p class="body-text mb-4">
                    Before DataCamp, I used to work at <a class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/engineering">Bloomberg LP</a> in the MARS team, where we were
                    building a comprehensive suite of risk management tools that enables professionals to analyze their
                    trading and investment portfolios.

                    I have been programming for most of my life, having initially started with C/C++ in middle school. I
                    then went on to do Java during my Bachelor's and Python during my Master's. I finally got to learn
                    modern C++ during my time at Bloomberg, and ended up combining Python and web development (TypeScript +
                    React) at DataCamp. In my spare time, I like to experiment with a lot of languages. The backend for this
                    website is Rust with a bit of HTMX and Tailwind to make it pretty and interactive. I have written a
                    small interpreter in Go, I like configuring my Neovim setup in Lua, and I have recently come to love the
                    simplicity of Zig.

                    This website, maybe blog in the future, is my own small piece on the internet. It's pretty minimalist as
                    I like to keep things simple. I've chosen to use Gruvbox as the website's color scheme, because I just
                    love it and use it for everything.
